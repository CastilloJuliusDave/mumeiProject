# mumeiProject2

Im trying to create my own Mumei Counter which she says "oh Hi!" each time.\
This Project is created because i want to learn and have fun while doing so.\
Im studying impomu.com code to create my own version.\
This project is not intended for others to see. Only for personal Close friends of mine.\
Do not share to others. im shy. hahaha\
